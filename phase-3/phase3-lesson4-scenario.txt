==================================================== 
scenario A:missing required redo log(current/active)
====================================================
 situation:
 ---------
 . instance crashed( shutdown abort or power failure)
 . one redo log group that is required for recovery is missing 
   . current or active 
 . datafiles exist
 . control file exists
 . undo exists
 
 can oracle guarantee correctness using redo?
  NO
  
 what oracle will do:
 -------------------
  1. Instance starts 
     . SGA allocated
	 . Background processes start
	 . PMON alive
	 * instance exists
	 
  2. database mounts
     . controlfile is read
	 . oracle learns
	   . datafiles 
	   . redo log structure
	   . checkpoint SCN
	 * oracle understands the database layout
	 
  3. oracle attempts recovery
     . checks redo required from last checkpoint
	 . detects missing current/active redo
	 * redo gap detected
	 
  4. oracle stops
     . database does not open 
	 . error : ORA-00313 ORA-00312
	 . alert log clearly mentions missing redo 
	 * this is intentional 
	 
 why oracle refuses to open:
 --------------------------
  without required redo 
   . oracle cannot roll forward
   . datafiles may be behind
   . opening would mean silent corruption
   
  * oracle chooses , downtime over wrong data
  
 ownership boundary:
 -----------------
 . at this point 
   . SMON cannot continue 
   . restarting won't help
   . oralce will not guess
 * DBA responsibility begins here

 DBA options:
 -----------
 1. restore missing redo (rare)
 2. incomplete recovery
 3. open RESETLOGS (data loss accepted)
 4. restore from backup
Decision depends on:
 1. business tolerance
 2. point-in-time requirements
 3. backup availability
 
** If redo is missing, instance recovery ends and media recovery begins

===================================================
scenario B: undo tablespace is corrupted or missing: 
===================================================

 situation:
 ---------
  . isntance crashed
  . undo tablespace datafile is corrupt or missing
  . redo exists
  . controlfiles exists
  . datafiles exist
  
 first question:
 --------------
  can oracle guarantee logical consistency?
   NO , because rollback of uncommitted work depends on undo.
   
 what oracle will do:
 ------------------
 1. Instance starts
 2. database mounts
 3. oracle attempts recovery
  . redo roll-forward begins(possible)
  . oracle reaches rollback phase
  . needs undo to:
     . roll back uncommitted transactions
	 . clean up temp segments
  * undo unreadable/ missing
  
 oracle behaviour splits:
 -----------------------
 CASE 1: oracle refuses to open
  1. database stays mounted
  2. errors indicate undo problem 
  3. DBA intervention required
  
 CASE 2: Oracle opens but is unsafe
  1. database opens
  2. SMON cannot complete rollback
  3. symptoms later:
    . ora-01555
	. hanging sessions
	. query errors
	. logical inconsistencies
 
 why this is tricky:
 ------------------
 Redo protects physical correctness, Undo protects logical correctness
 Oracle may be physically consistent, but logically unsafe
 
 That’s why:
 Undo problems are more dangerous than redo problems.
 Redo loss stops you loudly.
 Undo corruption can hurt you silently.

 ownership boundary:
 ------------------
 once undo is broken:
  1. SMON cannot finish its job safely
  2. restarting won't magically fix it 
  3. DBA must:
     . create/switch undo
	 . recover undo 
	 . or perform controlled recovery
 
Hardened mental rule:
--------------------
 1. redo answers "what happened"
 2. undo answers "what must no be visible"
 3. if undo is broken, correctness is at risk even if the DB opens
 
============================================== 
scenario C: contolfile is missing or corrupted:
==============================================

 situation:
 ---------
  . instance crashed or is starting fresh
  . all controlfiles are missing or unreadable
  . datafiles exist
  . redo logs may exist
  . undo may exist
  
 first question:
 --------------
  does oracle know what this database is?
   no, because the control file defines the database
   
 what oracle will do:
 -------------------
 1. instance starts
 2. oracle attempts to mount the database
    . needs controlfile to:
	  . identify datafiles
	  . identify redo logs
	  . know checkpoint SCN
	* controlfile not found / unreadable 
 3. oracle stops immediately
    . database does not mount 
	. error like
	   . ora-00205 / ora-00210
	. alert log clearly says controlfile missing 
    * this is hard stop
	
 why oracle cannot proceed:
 -------------------------
  without a controlfile, oracle does not know:
   1. which files belongs to the database
   2. whether datafiles are consistent
   3. where recovery should start
   4. even the DB name and incarnation
  * opening the DB would be pure guessing, oracle refuses

  ownership boundary:
  ------------------
  at this point:
   . SMON cannot act
   . restarting is useless
   . oracle will not attempt recovery
   * DBA must intervene
      only DBA can restore controlfile from backup
	            or recreate controlfile manually (expert level)
 
 hardened mental rule:
 --------------------
  No controlfile = no database identity
  No identify    = oracle stops
