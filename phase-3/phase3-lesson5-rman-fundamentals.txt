phase3-lesson5:RMAN fundamentals(seen through the recovery lens)
---------------------------------------------------------------
 RMAN is not a backup tool.
 RMAN is a recovery decision engine
 
 ===================
 1. why RMAN exists:
 ===================
  oracle separates respinsibilities:
   . oracle (SMON) -> fixes logical inconsistency
   . DBA ( RMAN )  -> fixes physcial uncertainty
 
 RMAN exists because:
 ------------------- 
  1. files can be lost
  2. disks can fail
  3. controlfiles can disappear
  4. redo can be missing
 
* RMAN is how you restore certainty

 =======================================================
 2. RMAN does only TWO things(everythings else is detail)
 =======================================================
  1. Restore:
  ----------
   bring files back from backup
  eg:
   1. datafile missing
   2. controlfiles missing
   3. undo file corrupted
  restore = file comes back
 
 2. recover:
 ----------
  apply redo to make restored files consistent
  eg:
   1. apply archived redo
   2. roll forward to SCN
   3. reach a consistent point-in-time
  recover = file becomes correct
  
 Golden rule:
 -----------
  restore is about existence
  recover is about correctness
  
 ================================== 
 3. Mapping lesson4 -> RMAN actions
 ===================================
  scenario A: missing required redo
   . restore cannot fix missing redo
   . recovery is incomplete by definition
   . decision required:
      1. incomplete recovery
	  2. resetlogs
	  3. accept data loss
	  
 ** RMAN obeys your decision - it won't choose for you
 
 scenario B: undo corruption
  . restore undo datafile (if backed up)
  . or create new undo and clean logically
  . RMAN may be involved, but decision comes first
  
 ** undo recovery is about corerctness, not mechanics
 
 scenario c: controlfile loss
  . restore control file from RMAN 
  . or recreate manually 
  . only after this can recovery begin 
  
 ** without controlfile, RMAN itself is blind
 
 ==================================
 4. what RMAN will never do for you
 ==================================
  important boundaries:
   RMAN will not: 
    1. decide how much data loss is acceptable 
	2. decide to open RESTLOGS
	3. guess missing redo 
	4. override correctness rule
  ** all these are DBA decisions
 
 ====================== 
 5. RMAN decision flow
 ======================
Database problem
   ↓
Is a file missing or damaged?
   ├─ NO → Oracle handles it
   └─ YES
        ↓
     RESTORE file(s)
        ↓
     RECOVER file(s)
        ↓
     OPEN database (or RESETLOGS)
 
** RMAN does not fix databases, it executes DBA decisions safely
