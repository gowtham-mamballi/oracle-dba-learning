Lesson07-user, roles and privilages
-----------------------------------
======
1.user
======
who is connecting
 a user is a:
 -----------
  . is a db account
  . owns objects(tables, indexes, procedures)
  . connects to oracle using username and password
  eg: user = schema owner
  * user is an account that owns objects and connects to database

===========  
2.privilage
===========
what can be done

 system privilage
 ---------------
 allow actions at database level
 eg:
 . create session 
 . create tables
 . alter user
 
 object privilage
 ---------------
 allow actions on specific objects
 eg:
 . select
 . insert
 . update
 . delete
 . execute
 . select on hr.employees

=======
3. role 
=======
collection of privilage
a role is a :
 . named group of privilage
 . make privilage managment easy 
 . is the recommended way to grant access 
 * role = bundle of privilage

======================= 
4. why DBA prefer roles
=======================
instead of :
 grant select, insert, update to 50 users;
 
DBA do :
 grant privilage to role
 grant role to user
 
uses:
. easy revocation 
. consistency
. less error prone

===============================
5. default vs non-default roles
===============================
default     - enable at login 
non-default - enable manually 
why this matters
 . security 
 . application behaviour
 . stored procedures
 
===========
6. profiles
===========
profile controls
 . password rules
 . resource limits (cpu, sessions)
 
eg:
 password_life_time
 failed_login_attempts
 
| Item      | Purpose              |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| User      | Identity             |
| Privilege | Permission           |
| Role      | Group of permissions |
| Profile   | Limits & rules       |


****
User vs Role vs Privilege
User is a database account that connects to the database and owns objects

Role is a collection of privileges assigned to users

Privilege defines what actions a user is allowed to perform

System vs Object Privileges
System privileges allow actions at database level
Object privileges allow actions on specific objects like tables or indexes

Why roles are preferred
Roles make privilege management easier,
consistent, and less error-prone across users
