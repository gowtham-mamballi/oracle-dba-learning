Lesson8:Performace view:
-----------------------
==========================
1. DBA performance mindset
==========================
 . when someone says
   database is slow
    A DBA does not guess

 . DBA will ask 
  1. who is connected?
  2. what are they doing?
  3. Are they waiting?
  4. on what?
  
* all these answer starts from V$views

===============================
2. V$session - who is connected
===============================
 First view DBA should check
 
 What it tells you:
 -----------------
  1. Active sessions
  2. Idle sessions
  3. who is waiting
  4. what they are waiting on 
  
 core columns:
 ------------
  . SID, SERIAL#
  . USERNAME
  . STATUS ( active/inactive)
  . EVENT
  . WAIT_CLASS
  
* v$session -- shows current sesison activity and waits
  
==============================  
3. v$sql - what sql is running
==============================
 Shows parsed sql statements
 
 what it tells you:
 -----------------
 . sql text
 . execution count
 . cpu usage
 . buffer gets
 . elapsed time
 
 * not all slow databases have slow sql - but most do 
   we don't tune here, we observe

=======================================
4. v$system_event - where time is spent
=======================================
 shows system wide wait events since startup
 
 what it tells you:
 -----------------
 . major wait events
 . total waits
 . time waited
 eg: 
  1. db file sequential read
  2. log file sync
  3. buffer busy waits
  
 * v$system_event shows cumulative wait statistics
 
==============
5. wait vs cpu
==============
 A session can be:
  1. on cpu
  2. waiting
 
 Waiting is classified into:
  . user I/O
  . system I/O
  . commit
  . concurrency
  . configuration
  
 * performance != CPU only
 
===================== 
6. active vs inactive
=====================
 Active:
  session is using CPU or waiting
  
 Inactive:
  session is idle (waiting for client)
  
* inactive sessions are usually not a problem

** Never tune without knowing the wait event
