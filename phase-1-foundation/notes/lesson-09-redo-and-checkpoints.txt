Lesson_9: starup, shutdown and instance recovery
-----------------------------------------------

========================
1. Instance vs Database:
======================== 
  Instance = memory(SGA) + background processes
  Database = datafiles + control files + redo logs
  
startup = bringing the instance up and attaching it to the database

================
2. startup pahse
===============
 
 1. NOMOUNT
 ----------
	. allocates SGA
	. starts background processes
	. reads init parameters
  what is not accessed:
    . no control files
	. no datafiles
	. no redo logs
 
 ** prepare memory and processes
 
 2. MOUNT
 ---------
   . opens control files
   . knows database structure
   . knows locations of datafiles and redo logs 
  what is not accessed:
   . data inside tables
 
 ** oracle now knows what the database looks like 
 
 3. OPEN
 -------
   . opens datafiles
   . opens redo logs
   . database becomes usable 
   
 ** make data accessible to users
 
========================== 
3. clean shutdown vs crash 
==========================

 clean shutdown:
 --------------- 
  before shutdown:
   1. DBWR writes dirty buffers
   2. checkpoint ensures consistency
   3. datafiles and control files are synchronized
  result:
   . no recovery needed at next startup
   . startup is fast
  
  crash/abort/instance failure
  ----------------------------
   before crash:
    1. diry buffers may exist
	2. redo is safe on disk
