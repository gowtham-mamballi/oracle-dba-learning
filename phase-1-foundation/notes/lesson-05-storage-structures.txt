Lesson 5: Shared pool internals
-------------------------------

 The shared pool is a working area for sql and metadata, not a cache with guarantees.

oracle uses it to:
----------------- 
 . Parse sql
 . store execution plan 
 . coordinate concurrent work
 
it is:
------
 . shared
 . mutable
 . under constant pressure
 
=========================================== 
1. what the shared pool is constantly doing
=========================================== 
  . allocating memory for new cursors
  . reusing memory for existing cursors
  . aging out old cursors
  . protecting memory structures
  . handling concurrent access

===========  
2. ORA-0431 
===========
 unable to allocate x bytes of shared memory 
 oracle could not find a contiguous chunk of free memory that matches the request at that moment
 
key implications
----------------
 . total free memory may exist
 . but it may be fragmented
 . or locked by other activity
 
why it appears suddenly
-----------------------
 from the outside:
  . nothing changed
  . it worked yesterday
  
 Internally:
  . cursor churn increased
  . hard parsing increased
  . memory fragmentation increased
  . concurrency increased
  
 eventually:
  .one allocation request fails
  .error surfaces
  
* The error is the result, not the cause.
