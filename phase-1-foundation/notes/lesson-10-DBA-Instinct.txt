Lesson10: Logs, Diagnostics and DBA instince:
--------------------------------------------
  tools don't makes DBAs good , judgment does.

=============================
 1. Most important DBA logs:
=============================
 The alert log records:
  1. startup and shutdown events
  2. checkpoints
  3. redo log switches
  4. recovery progress
  5. ora-errors that matter
  6. structural changes

* Important rule: if something feels wrong, read the alert log before touching anything

============================
2. What the alert log is not:
============================

 1. a full error dump
 2. a performance dashboard
 3. a place for every warning

so:
 1. not every ora-message - panic
 2. context matters

we should read:
 patterns
 sequences
 timing
not single lines

================================
3.trace files(when you go deeper)
================================
Trace files:
 1. are session or process specific 
 2. contain detailed diagnostics
 3. are verbose and technical

use trace files when:
 1. alert log points to something specific 
 2. oracle asks for it
 3. you are diagnosing repeatable issues

* don't start with trace files, they are step two not step one

==========================
4.common DBA panic mistakes
==========================
 X -- restarting the database immediately
   why it's bad:
   ------------
    1. destroys evidence
	2. may worsen recovery
	3. masks the real issues

 X -- flushing shared pool/ buffer cache blindly
   why it's bad:
   ------------
    1. cuases hared parse storms
	2. cpu spikes
	3. tempoarary relief, long-term harm
	
 X -- blaming disk or network first
   most issues are:
   ----------------
    . parsing
	. memory pressure
	. concurrency
	. workload change
  disk is often innocent

=======================
5.The DBA triage order:
=======================
 when something feels wrong:
  1. read alert log
  2. ask: Is oracle recovering or working
  3. observe before acting
  4. act only when you understand the phase oracle is in 

=====================
6.senior DBA instinct  
=====================
  junior DBA: 
   something's wrong - do something
  
  senior DBA:
   oracle is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. let it finish
  
 eg:
 --
  1. slow startup     --> recovery running
  2. High cpu, low IO --> parsing/shared pool
  3. redo wait's      --> commit pressure
